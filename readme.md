0. We assume that you have downloaded project, and made host for project_dir/public
1. Use composer install to get important things 
2. In config/database.example.php edit database settings or create database r1st4w4ll,and add user rista with password rista123 in mysql(app will use config/database.php file, so if you're okay with default settings just rename file)
3. Tables will be automatically added 
4. If you want to put data in database, you can find previous added data in database/seeds
5. If you have trouble with adding table automatically, you have sql code for that in database/migrations
6. you are ready to go!
